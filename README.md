# Introduction to Graph Theory and Complex Networks Analysis

**Course description**

Multiple problems can be modeled based on entities and their relationships. Graph theory (GT) allows us to define nodes and connections between them to represent and analyze complex processes found in various areas of science and technology. Today, there is a large amount of data that can be used to understand our world from things and their relationship between them and its ecosystem.

In this course, we start with an introduction to GT and complex network analysis with an application using Social media data. We will explore widely used tools from GT, network's topology metrics, most common centrality measures, and some applications. We will code in Python and will explore libraries to create, explore, analyze, and visualize complex networks. To this purpose, we will create graphs by using NetworkX library, NumPy and Pandas for data transformation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. We will get into longitudinal analysis of evolving networks based on topology and centrality metrics. At the end of these course, you will be able to create, analize, and visualize complex networks.
